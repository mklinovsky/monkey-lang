# Monkey Interpreter in Go

A simple interpreter for the **Monkey** programming language, implemented in Go. This project demonstrates how to build an interpreter from scratch, covering tokenization, parsing, evaluation, and running a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

## Features

- Lexical analysis (tokenizing source code)
- Parsing with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Expression evaluation
- Simple REPL for interactive use
- Supports basic language features like variable assignments, functions, conditionals, and loops

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the book [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com) by Thorsten Ball. It demonstrates the process of building an interpreter for the Monkey programming language in Go.
